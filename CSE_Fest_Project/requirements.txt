# This file is for Python package requirements.
# The Python script (calculate.py) in this project uses only
# standard built-in libraries (`sys`, `json`), so no external
# packages need to be installed via pip.
#
# If you were to add libraries like `numpy` or `pandas`, you would
# list them here, for example:
# numpy==1.21.5
# pandas==1.3.4
