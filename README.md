Step 1: Start Your Local Server

Open the XAMPP Control Panel on your computer.
Make sure the Apache module is started (click the "Start" button).
Make sure the MySQL module is started.
Step 2: Make Sure the Project is in the Right Place

Confirm that your project folder, CSE_Fest, is inside the htdocs directory of your XAMPP installation.
